# VehicleData
Write a Java program that incorporates a loop that prompts a user for vehicle data. Vehicle data are private fields in a Vehicle class that include:

String make
String model
double miles per gallon
Each vehicle object is stored in a linked list.

After the user completes the data entry, output the contents of the linked list in ascending sorted order by miles-per-gallon to a text file that can be opened and viewed using a simple plain-text editor such as notepad.

Validate numeric data for miles-per-gallon.
